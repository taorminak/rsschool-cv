## ABOUT

Passionate about programming. Fast-learner, adherent of the idea of the long-life learning. Adaptable and creative.

Working as a language teacher for a long time, I have always paid attention to the trends in education such as the strongest influence of technologies in the field. A few years ago, I started thinking about changing my career path, and it was only natural to go on a journey as a programmer. I studied how to code HTML & CSS, Javascript & React.js and continue to deepen my knowledge with the help of the various courses and professional literature. 

I like to spend time productively and hope to significantly expand the list of frameworks and programming languages I know over time, as well as to implement some inspiring high-quality projects.

## CODE EXAMPLE
**Sum without highest and lowest number** 
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ). The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value. Mind the input validation.
```
function sumArray(array) {
  if (array == null || array.length == 0 || array.length == 1) {
    return +0;
  } else {
    let sum = 0;
    let a = Math.max.apply(Math, array);
    let b = Math.min.apply(Math, array);
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
    return sum - a - b;
  }
}
